            Don’t worry – there is nothing wrong with you. Boys’ penises start growing during puberty, which is usually between 11 and 15 years but can begin earlier or later. It’s natural for teenage boys to compare their penises, but since everyone reaches puberty at different times, it’s normal for boys of the same age to have different size penises.

            Dear Auntie Stella
            <br/>

I am a guy about to turn 14 and there is a problem which is really bothering me. It’s my penis which is too small. I am worried because it is not growing like others I have seen and that this will affect my life when I have sex later. Please tell me Auntie, what is the correct size penis for a 14-year-old boy because this is making me miserable.
<br/>
Peter
